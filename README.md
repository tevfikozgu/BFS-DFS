# BFS-DFS Algorithm
In this application, BFS and DFS are search algorithms are implemented. It is possible to reach two algorithms and compare them. For this application, cryptoarithmetic puzzles will be solved.


To execute this program, initially these steps must be done:

* First download all files.
* In the next step, compile main.cpp by g++ -Wall -Werror main.cpp -o main

## DFS Execution:

* Run file as ./main DFS **I1** **I2** **O1** **outputFileNamme.txt**


## BFS Execution:

* Run file as ./main BFS **I1** **I2** **O** **outputFileNamme.txt**


Both codes execute search operation according to selected algorithm. This command has 3 parameters that are **I1**, **I2**, **O**. I1 and I2 are the inputs that will be sum and summation of them is equal to O. At the end, puzzle keys will be found and written to file nammed **outputFileNamme.txt**. Also in this file, running time and selected algorithm will be seen.
